            <p><em>Based on Peter Thiel's 2013 SXSW Lecture: “You Are Not A Lottery Ticket”</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Imagine a tennis match. There are two players, whose biomechanics are well understood, the court’s surface, the physical properties of which are known, a ball, which exhibits predictable comportment, and two rackets about which all conceivable questions have been answered. Could a sage observer predict the outcome of the match? Anyone who claims to be able to predict such events with definite accuracy is, rightfully, branded delusional. A slight, but unforeseen, perturbation, a racket swung fractionally too early, can reverse the run of play. On the other hand, he who asserts that the victor has no one, or nothing, to thank save Lady Fortuna is also mistaken. The extent to which determinacy is outmuscled, or not, by indeterminacy, will almost certainly remain an elusive question—as it has been for many centuries. Nevertheless, it is striking that the “official religion” of the modern world is one which exalts the primacy of chance and indeterminacy.</p>
<p>When future trends are discussed, the chief concern of most interlocutors is simply whether one should be pessimistic, or optimistic, about the future. Yet, the future can also be determinate or indeterminate. In other words, does a society have a definite, tangible idea about what the future will bring? Or is it clueless?</p>
<p>The Western world is firmly in the camp of indeterminacy. Perhaps, most would suggest that the future will be one evermore dominated by digital technology, but few could cogently argue how such a world might pan out. Indeed, the idealism of the nascent tech boom (Facebook’s dogmas are a good example here), which professed that the emergence of a more connected world would unequivocally result in harmony, has subsided, and has been replaced by a growing sense of unease. For example, it is now apparent that social networks incentivise maelstroms of misinformation, goad the bifurcation of our society, and uniquely expose the integrity of politics to the skulduggery of foreign aggressors. Sure, benefits are also reaped from the harvest of digital technologies—one can hardly imagine how catastrophic the pandemic would have been without them—but the important observation, nonetheless, is simply that we are less sure about the nature of the future.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago in the United States, one gets the sense that there existed a much clearer sense of how the future was going to bring about improvements. The automobile, refrigerators, the plane, the radio were all to ameliorate the living condition of Americans. Fifty years earlier, in the United Kingdom (“the workshop of the world”), whose inhabitants had now broadly concluded that industrialisation had put more money in their pockets and offered them a life-style unattainable to their agrarian ancestors, similarly, through the construction of an extensive network of railways and canals, demonstrated a determinate view of how the future could be built to be better. The remnants of the Victorian growth spurt are visible in almost every British town: a panoply of railway stations, red-brick terraced houses, colleges, museums, Town Halls, and pavilions, dwarf in number the architectural contributions of any other era, suggesting a zeitgeist of restlessness and determinate foresight. In contrast, the modern investor has no definite idea of where to put their money to work, rather they favour a portfolio strategy since no one knows precisely which companies might succeed.</p>
<p>Low interest rates indicate that few know what to do with money—that entrepreneurs are running out of ideas. In such an indeterminate environment, investment is low since it endows creditors with meagre returns. In response, central banks, who might desire a “hotter” economy, then feel pressure to increase the supply of money, further driving down interest rates. Overburdened with uncertainty, money ceases to be a medium of exchange but rather exists as a hedge against an unknowable future. On the contrary, in a determinate world, money is more a medium of exchange, since people have a clear idea of what they want to do with it. One might then theorise that an indeterminate world, such as ours, is over-financialised as it is deterred from concrete enterprise, whether engineering, construction, energy, or transport. Why do parents wish for their children to become lawyers, doctors, or accountants? Partly because these professions are somewhat inoculated from the virus of variability. Though perfectly reasonable from the individual’s point of view, it is difficult to see how funnelling hordes of gifted prospects into risk-averse occupations does not burden economic dynamism.</p>
<p>At the political level, the shift from determinacy, a clear, defined way in which the future would be better, to indeterminacy, is perhaps more marked. Modern electoral politics is ruled by the pollster. Since the death of Thatcherism and Reaganomics, the British and American Prime Ministers and Presidents can broadly be characterised as savvy interpreters of public opinion, shifting—blowing in the wind—so as to win over the broadest possible coalition. A less benign interpretation of this phenomenon, however, is that politicians, like investors, have run out of ideas; they resort instead to promising everything. If Economics is the study of trade-offs, why one cannot have one’s cake and eat it, then the modern politician is the anti-economist for the politician assures the electorate that they can have it all. The politician is the myopic father who grants his son his every wish because he does not know how he wants to attempt to sculpt his son’s sensibilities—the indeterminate father.</p>
<p>Furthermore, transfer payments, rather than investment (such as infrastructure investment) have swelled. If investment is borrowing from the future to the benefit of our descendants, then transfer payments as well as subsidies, such as entitlement spending or farmers’ subsidies, are borrowing from the future at the expense of our descendants, in an attempt to shield us from the indeterminacy our own time. An indeterminacy that we are surely responsible for. This is not to say that these forms of spending are illegitimate. Yet, it does signal that even our governments do not know what to do with tax revenue, and so, instead resort to simply re-allocating wealth—even if it means only raising 90 pence for every pound of spending. Investment requires optimism but also, if it is to yield returns, a lucid blueprint of how returns will be generated. Otherwise, one finds a financial system that, rather than funding innovation and enterprise, sees capital being diversified and completing circular loops because no one is allowed to have a clear vision of the future.</p>
<p>The crudest form of the question of luck is the following: to what extent is luck to be overcome in one’s quest for individual success?  George Washington, the greatest exemplification of how individuals direct the course of the river of history, frequently exposed himself, not aided by his towering figure, to the fire of the enemy. It was frequently remarked throughout the Revolutionary Wars that it was only by the intercession of Divine Providence that he had not fallen in battle. Washington and almost all historical figures, believe that, facing the torrent of history’s chaos, luck is an obstacle to be overcome rather than a force to be bowed down to. For example, Winston Churchill, commenting on his becoming Prime Minister in the midst of the Second World War (1940), recalled that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I felt as if I was walking with destiny, and that all my past life had been but a preparation for this hour and this trial.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Churchill had a determinate interpretation of his life: he had come into existence to defeat the Nazi regime and that would be the task to which he was to dedicate himself to. An indeterminate view would have had him say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I felt as if I was on a random walk with chance and that I had no idea what my life had been but a series of inconsequential and meaningless events bearing no foreseeable connection to this hour and this trial.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides making a series of gargantuan blunders throughout his career, Churchill’s quasi-mystical view of his own life is surely nothing short of irrational. Had he been properly equipped with the tools of statistical and probabilistic analysis, he might have realised that the odds of him having trodden the path he, and the nation, trod were vanishingly small. But does one have to be delusional to accomplish rare feats? Are statistical thinkers indeed cursed by statistical thinking?</p>
<p>At the “macro-level”, statistical thinking is extremely helpful—our world is too complex to be able to predict precisely who, or which companies, might take off. No one could have predicted that Mark Zuckerberg was going to found Facebook and that it would reach astronomical hights. However, was it necessary for Mark Zuckerberg to believe, perhaps as we all do, in his unique value and in the inevitability of Facebook’s success? Should one have a determinate view of the world if one is to be truly innovative? Presumably, there would be more innovation, greater efficiency, and hence more growth, in a world in which individuals were less inclined towards forms of insurance (stable, track careers) and instead were more entrepreneurial; each trying to bend the future to one’s will. A believer in nuclear energy, for example, would toil day and night to see to the proliferation of their product, regardless of the probabilistically bleak outlook.</p>
<p>The shift from determinacy to indeterminacy is mirrored in mathematics by the shift from calculus to statistics or culturally by the shift from substance to processes. So, when thinking about whether a start-up might perform well, the focus is seldom on substance but rather on the process; how the company organises its systems to maximise productivity. One cannot ask about substance—whether the product is good, for example—since that would imply that one is able to predict consumers’ tastes. That would be blasphemous in the modern world.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many ways in which we are perhaps more determinate today than in bygone eras. Polarisation suggests that more of us believe we are undoubtedly right, governments believe that they can tame uncertainty, and our children are prevented from being exposed to unpredictability lest they come away with scratches. Regardless, this blog is simply intended to provoke thought and to point out the ways in which indeterminacy reigns supreme. As George Will points out, we are seldom consistent in our tendencies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“if we could tax Americans’ cognitive dissonance we could balance the budget.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><br></p>

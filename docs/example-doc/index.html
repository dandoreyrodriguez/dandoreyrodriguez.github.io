<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Ulysses S. Grant served his Presidency during a tumultuous period in US History. He was expected to reconstruct the Union, to ensure that the Civil War had not been fought in vain and lead the nation to prosperity. Some historians, usually writing during the late 19th century and early 20th century, have regarded his Presidency as rampantly corrupt, loathing of the south and inefficient— a disaster. Grant’s active support of a sound Reconstruction, the implementation of a biracial democracy in the light of emancipation, led many to despise him, an objection often accompanied by a dogged belief in racial segregation. In fact, with particular reference to the administrative blunders of Reconstruction, these historians even strove to demonstrate the dangers of fully implementing the 15th Amendment (enshrined as law under Grant) which bestowed suffrage upon African American males, insinuating that not subduing the black vote would again bring turmoil. Conversely, some post-revisionist historians criticise Grant for stalling on Reconstruction during his final years; after his Presidency, “Home Rule” (White Supremacy) would be restored in the south and, logically, Reconstruction failed. Politically, the two main parties abandoned African Americans and redoubled their efforts to please whites, especially southern whites. More recently, historians have argued that Grant was a visionary advocate for racial equality, a capable politician, particularly relating to foreign affairs, but often betrayed by those who enjoyed his support. On these grounds, the case can safely be made that, with regards to corruption, Reconstruction, racial equality and personal competence, the Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant was not a disaster.</p>
<p>William Dunning, William Gillette and Ron Chernow put forth differing interpretations of Grant’s Presidency. In “Reconstruction, Political and Economic, 1865-1877: The Climax of Radical Reconstruction (1869-1872)”, Dunning denounces Grant for his role in Reconstruction and questionable temperament. According to Dunning, Grant spearheaded an unlawful, vengeful occupation of the south that stripped southern whites of their rights. Coupled with swirling allegations of alcoholism, Grant’s historical interpretation, for many years, was cast with this interpretation of history in mind. A post-revisionist historian, William Gillette attempts to re-evaluate Grant’s Presidency in a more nuanced and balanced fashion in “Retreat from Reconstruction: A Study in Incongruities”. Gillette considers Grant’s policy in the south inconsistent and lacking vigour, charging Grant with the failure of Reconstruction. Gillette intentionally refrains from attributing excessive credit to Grant, giving little importance to the political constraints that hindered him. On the other hand, Ron Chernow in “Grant: Redeemers”, attempts to correct for the lack of appreciation of political context, arguing that Grant was a competent politician and a champion of racial equality. In his view, Grant’s historical evaluation has been unjustly smeared by the excesses of both the Dunning school and post-revisionist historians, such as Gillette.</p>
<h3 id="dunning">Dunning</h3>
<p>During the early 20th century, it was predominantly argued that Grant’s Presidency brought about a renewed republican oppression of the South marred by corruption and inefficiency. Dunning, in “Reconstruction, Political and Economic, 1865-1877: The Climax of Radical Reconstruction (1869-1872)”, dismisses Grant as an incompetent, radical nepotist who oversaw a vengeful demoralisation of the South. Regarding Grant’s cabinet appointees, Dunning claims that they were “in large measure determined by personal friendship or unintelligent caprice”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: ironically Grant openly advocated for a more transparent, meritocratic civil service.</p>
<p>Post-war political appointments operated via the “spoils system”, whereby the victorious party distributed appointments to its supporters (political or financial). The government had grown significantly but meritocratic bureaucratic practices would only follow suit much later. Certain cabinet members, proposed by Grant, were indeed questionable, one even unlawful. After A. T. Stewart had been confirmed as treasury secretary, the administration realised that it had infringed an old law that barred the treasury secretary from having any connection to “trade or commerce”. This demonstrated Grant’s acute lack of political experience and was used by his opponents to smear him. Dunning argues that Grant exhibited a “dogged refusal to see that his friendship had been used for unworthy purposes, when the fact was obvious to everybody else, [which] was a source of unlimited scandal.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  For example, Grant’s “brother-in-law’s involvement in the Black Friday scheme to corner the gold market clouded an otherwise creditable record.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>” The subsequent financial instability and the hint that Grant himself had knowledge of the ordeal, fuelled allegations of Caesarism. Public sentiment, encapsulated in the Harper’s Weekly, suggested that, “The Chief business of the executive had become the distribution of patronage”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. This depiction of Grant as being manipulated by personal connection and crooked, has tainted evaluations of his Presidential temperament; according to Dunning, “the result was inevitably an administration of caprice, of favourites, and of malodorous intrigue”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, a scathing condemnation of Grant’s corruption.</p>
<p>Nonetheless this view is contested. In line with Grant’s position on civil rights, he was revolutionary in assigning a significant number of African Americans and Jews to important government positions. Having appointed Ebenezer D. Basset, the first African American diplomat, Chernow points out that his “efforts transcended high-profile appointments as he named a record number of ordinary blacks”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and that he had appointed “more than fifty Jewish citizens.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  Dunning does not take this into account, a fact which is unsurprising given his romantic view of the South’s “lost cause”. Nor does Dunning acknowledge the fine judgement that Hamilton Fish demonstrated in advising the President on diplomatic affairs, a demonstration that Grant was often not spurred by impulse.</p>
<p>Convinced that northern Reconstruction was executed with spite, Dunning objects to Grant’s role in promoting equality, seeing it as an overreach of government authority. He explains that, “The (Enforcement) act involved a very wide extension of the national authority into a field hitherto left to the states”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and that the Enforcement Act of May 1870 legalised an unfounded interpretation of the 15th amendment. The Enforcement Act sought to ensure that the amendment was being upheld, and so placed elections in the jurisdiction of the federal government. Again, Grant proved to be ahead of his time, steering the Federal Government in such a way that it became a custodian of freedom rather than its principal aggressor. The ultimate cessation of Reconstruction would pave the way for Jim Crow and a return to the subjugation of the African American vote, which Grant fought with conviction to protect. With respect to the Second Enforcement Act, or the Ku-Klux Klan Act, Dunning thought that the “drastic” measure was excessive since the Klan demonstrated only “sporadic” expressions of “social demoralization” even stating that, “The idea that anything like “rebellion” or “war” existed in the south was justly denounced as far-fetched and visionary”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Unfortunately for African Americans, Reconstruction did bring a war-like violence, particularly during elections. Militias were common and state-governments often requested federal support during episodes of particular violence. The Act also suspended habeas corpus in nine South Carolina counties to facilitate the prosecution of Klansmen. Dunning claims that such potent action was a misinterpretation of race relations, postulating that the “shocking barbarity in the attitude of low-class whites towards the freedmen” was “concerned with purely local incidents of radical misrule, and was ridiculously remote from any purpose that could be fairly called “rebellion” against the United States”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Nevertheless, this is hardly the case. The 1873 Colfax Massacre demonstrates an intense animosity between the races: Grant commented that “a butchery of citizens was committed… which in bloodthirstiness and barbarity is hardly surpassed by any acts of savage warfare”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Moreover, as the ensuing decades would prove, the schism between the races was deeply entrenched, traceable to the Revolutionary Wars, and still continues to divide the country; by no means was it simply the result of Radical Republican misadministration.</p>
<p>The late 19th and early 20th centuries were dominated by the traditional (Dunning) interpretation. “In this view, vindictive Radical Republicans fastened black supremacy upon the defeated south, unleashing an orgy of corruption presided over by unscrupulous carpetbaggers, traitorous scalawags, and ignorant freedmen. Eventually, the white community of the south overthrew this misgovernment and restored Home Rule”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. This Reconstruction narrative permeated popular culture and academia, through works such as “The Tragic Era” or “The Birth of a Nation”. Understanding the struggle for control over Reconstruction’s story casts serious doubts over the creditworthiness of Dunning’s work as a piece of scholarship. Dunning’s tainted interpretation of Reconstruction can be easily rebuffed; yet, it cannot be denied that Grant displayed a weakness in judgement when individuals whom he knew were involved, paving the way for a scandal-ridden administration. However, Dunning cannot claim that Grant himself was anything but incorruptible. Rather, he was easily manipulated, which prohibited him from clearer judgement.</p>
<p>The advent of the so-called “Second Reconstruction”, more commonly referred to as the Civil Rights Era, forced the United States to grapple once again with issues of Reconstruction: African American suffrage, race relations and economic freedom. Reconstruction itself was reinterpreted. No longer was it seen predominantly as an administrative disaster perpetuated by the unholy trinity of freedmen, carpetbags and scalawags (the dominant interpretation until the Civil Rights Era), but instead as a noble, doomed experiment that attempted to advance racial equality. Since Grant served through much of the Reconstruction era, it is not surprising that his legacy is greatly influenced by interpretations of this episode of American History. Interestingly, Woodrow Wilson, a fierce opponent of Reconstruction, expressed the historical Dunning consensus on Grant, describing him as an “honest simple-hearted soldier that had not added prestige to the presidential office… He ought never to have been made President”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="gillette">Gillette</h3>
<p>Although historical interpretations of the period of Reconstruction have benefitted from the positive evaluations of revisionist historians in the 1960s and 1970s, “Grant had apparently been bypassed&hellip; only to be tarnished by the ensuing wave of more critical revisionist studies”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. William Gillette’s “Retreat from Reconstruction: A Study in Incongruities” is such a work, arguing that Grant’s southern policy, character, integrity and political short-sightedness helped hasten the failure of Reconstruction. Gillette, regarding the legacy of the Dunning School’s verdict on Reconstruction, states that “those historians magnified [its] flaws”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. However, believing that the “pendulum has swung in the other direction”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, he regards some revisionist historians as “minimizing [Reconstruction’s] weaknesses and shortcomings”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Gillette thus takes extreme caution in attributing too much praise to Grant. Instead, he mounts an almost scornful critique of Grant’s conduct, concluding that “Had Grant provided an effective policy, clear direction, and strong leadership, he might have achieved a great deal”<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, implying that his Presidency was verging on the calamitous. In effect, Dunning and Gillette’s adjudications are almost interchangeable, although both approach Grant from vastly contrasting intellectual frameworks.</p>
<p>It was during Grant’s eight-year tenure that eight former Confederate states fell back into the grip of the Democratic Party. Gillette calls Grant’s southern policy a “study in incongruity: a curious confusing, changeable mix of boldness and timidity, decision and indecision… as he shifted between reinforcement and retrenchment, coercion and reconciliation”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. He argues that Grant’s lack of coherence regarding the southern question undermined the authority of Reconstruction, leading to its failure. Throughout his Presidency, several crises spawned in the south, almost exclusively concerning white, domestic terrorism against African Americans. Notwithstanding, Gillette claims that exclusively justifying Grant’s failure on Reconstruction with “unmitigated racism” is both “monolithic” and “too simplistic”<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Yet, Gillette acknowledges the “entrenched, armed, determined political opposition; civilian in appearance yet paramilitary in nature”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, referring to white terror in opposition to northern intervention. Still, he criticises Grant for not doing more and acting with malleability. According to Gillette, “[Grant] permitted the two extremes, arbitrary rule and unchecked anarchy to prevail in the South”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. The contrasting aims of Reconstruction, “how to reconcile the necessity of truly reuniting the country with a desire to provide justice and protection for freedmen”<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, meant that, clearly, Grant had to be conciliatory to the white south yet a protector of the freedman.  Therefore, Gillette is unfounded in this criticism since he interprets Grant’s necessary mix of mercy and force to be an “incongruity”<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> which in part brought about the failure of Reconstruction.  Gillette also overlooks the political constraints of the time. For example, Grant confessed that he did not intervene in Mississippi (1875) because if he had, “Republicans would lose Ohio elections on October 13th”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Added to this, whether through intimidation, racial campaigning or political appeal, southern whites accused the north of bayonet rule and pervasive corruption, thus spawning a fervent abhorrence of the Republican Party in the south. Given this political and social reality, it is not surprising that an unforgiving, coordinated strategy in the south was not sustainable; such a move would be political suicide. Local compromises, therefore, were a necessity of the Grant administration.</p>
<p>Gillette asserts that “there was just enough truth in the accusations of corruption… to lend credence to the conservatives’ criticism”<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Nonetheless, northern and southern corruption were indistinguishable. Alternatively, it was the spoils system and westward expansion, rather than Reconstruction or Grant, that paved the way for obscene corruption. Fuelled by a disdain of Reconstruction as a political programme, southern whites latched onto any scandal involving corrupt southern Reconstruction state governments for convenience’s sake. Consequently, the case for maladministration provoking opposition is also dubious.</p>
<p>Many historians, including post-revisionists such as Gillette, contend that Grant was guilty of nepotism, lacking in personal capabilities and political astuteness. According to Gillette, “cronyism played a part” in his Presidency which was also hampered by his “strain of capriciousness”<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> in decision-making.  Such an assertion is surprisingly similar to Dunning’s evaluation of Grant, both explicitly refer to his ‘caprice’. Gillette goes further, claiming that Grant, “engaged in favoratism, rewarding unreliable friends” and punished “honest critics”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Gillette cites Grant’s attempt at advancing his brother-in-law’s political career as an example. The critique is a well-founded one, family members and political appointees, who tended to be old military acquaintances, often found themselves at the centre of mass scrutiny. The Whiskey Ring and Crédit Mobilier incidents are just two scandals that perhaps led to a moral degradation of Grant that weakened his heroic status and the authority with which he operated. It is undeniable that these personal shortcomings undermined Grant’s tenure and his ability to pursue sensible policy.  Whilst fair to Grant concerning personal competence, Gillette’s refusal to praise Grant on Reconstruction forces one to question Gillette’s even-handedness. An interpretation which sought to be balanced seems to have waded towards the one-sided.</p>
<p>As for Grant’s inconsistencies, local dynamics had to be considered before intervention could be seen as constructive and effects on northern Republicans also had to be reconciled. Arguably, however, Grant’s political manoeuvring was a sign of skilful diplomacy; Grant had learnt how to address the distinct, competing Republican factions to cement his authority and the party’s prospects. Nevertheless, northerners had grown apathetic to the question of the south and there existed a strong feeling that the south “must be left to work out their own peace and salvation”<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Surely then, credit should be appropriated to Grant for what he did do, rather than condemning him for what he could have done in the absence of political turmoil.</p>
<h2 id="chernow">Chernow</h2>
<p>Ron Chernow, in “Grant: Redeemers”, presents a distinctly complementary interpretation of Grant’s accomplishments in the White House. Indeed, Chernow makes the case that history has been unjust to Grant; not appropriating enough credit to him for his demonstration of political astuteness and resolve in protecting African American political rights. Chernow rejects the assertions of the Dunning school, the idea that Grant and the Republicans imposed an “oppressive peace on honourable men who laid down their arms.”<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> Of course, the white plantation elite, and working class whites, never laid down their arms; Grant had to confront the “largest wave of domestic terrorism in American history”<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. On the other hand, Chernow argues that the revisionist historians who have criticised Grant for dwindling on military intervention in his later years, and questioned the consistency of Grant’s policy on Reconstruction, have “swung too far the other way”<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>, not properly recognising the constraints of the political situation. Grant indeed faced a herculean task: embracing four million new African American voters into the nation’s politics whilst placating the south and, more significantly, the north’s dwindling enthusiasm for bi-racial democracy.</p>
<p>By 1877, the end of Grant’s second Presidential term, Republican support had shifted away from a robust intervention in the south and towards the restoration of “home rule”, a term best summarised as “White Supremacy”<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Many looked forward to a time when “the negro will disappear from the field of national politics”<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>.  Perhaps, this was partially due to the economic cripple of the Panic of 1873. Indeed, fierce debate regarding the appropriate political response to the economic turmoil splintered the parties “dangerously along sectional lines (between the Northeast and the Midwest)”<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Diminishing support in the south was also partly a result of the Republican Party’s neglect for their southern political apparatus, preferring to concentrate efforts in the north<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.  This weakening of party unity perhaps explains, to some extent, Democratic success in 1776. Subsequent to that election, the United States would see a more rigid racial segregation, a contrast to the policies that Grant and the Radical Republicans had pursued. Therefore, Grant’s Reconstruction policy can be seen as admirable and ahead of his time. Chernow credits Grant for his efforts in “weaving” the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments into “the basic fabric of American life”<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>, which would set the legal groundwork for further Civil Rights advancements in the 20th century. Here, Chernow implies that Grant should be commended for his role in the rebirth of a new Republic that cherished universal, racial equality and for helping to (temporarily) erect that basic pillar in American life. On the ultimate failure of Reconstruction, Chernow considers that the “true wonder” is not that “Grant finally retreated from robust federal intervention” but that “he had the courage to persist for so long in his outspoken concern for black safety and civil rights” even against a “ferocious backlash”<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> from the Democrats and Republicans. In this, Chernow’s argument holds weight; Reconstruction failed because of the persistence of the old, southern elite in attempting to reassert their political and economic power, the dire political indifference that had gained popularity across the nation and the “drawing of the color line between the two parties” as a “weapon”<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Chernow cites Fredrick Douglass, a national figure seeking to bring parity between people of his race and whites, who regarded Grant a figure of immense stature: “Lincoln made him [African Americans] a freedman… Grant made him a citizen”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Clearly, Grant’s role in championing African Americans and Reconstruction has been neglected by many historians, a fact which Chernow is trying to overturn.</p>
<p>Portraying Grant as an inexorably corrupt despot has been a “convenient tool for Reconstruction opponents”<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> used to dismiss his Presidency. The Dunning school supposed that a return to the disenfranchisement of African Americans would lead to efficient and benign government, justification for the Jim Crow system. Chernow points out that this had led historians to neglect Grant’s achievements. He claims that this narrative, “overlooks the many outstanding figures, including Hamilton Fish… Akerman… Bistow …. Creswell… who he appointed”<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. Hamilton Fish in particularly has been lauded as one of the greatest Secretary of States in US history in spite of Grant’s blotted historical reputation. The Alabama Claims, for example, were a remarkable feat of measured statesmanship and forward thinking ingenuity.</p>
<p>The point should be made that 1870s corruption was not a by-product of Grant’s administration but rather that instances of Grant’s malfeasance were largely a result of two facts. Firstly, that the “main cause” of corruption was “the post-war expansion of the federal government”<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Grant, lamenting the insufficient patronage system, had expressed a desire for Civil Service reform to accompany a growing bureaucracy. Chernow does concede that “he should have championed the movement more vigorously”<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>; however, Civil Service reform was also politically impossible to enforce as Democrats almost unanimously, and unsurprisingly, opposed it: reform would prevent them from being able to distribute government posts upon assuming the reins of government. Secondly, Grant, in his last annual message to Congress, admits that for better or worse he had garnered “no previous political training” and that “it is impossible that where so many trusts are to be allotted that the right parties should be chosen in every instance”<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. Scandal seemed to follow the men he appointed to office, notably his aide Orville Babcock. When Grant’s trust was gained, he crossed “the line that separates tenacity from obstinacy”<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. This was the case during the Whiskey Scandal where Babcock was indicted and the President testified, a first in Presidential history. The ordeal became an emblem of Grant’s cronyism. Historians, in spite of this, believe that Grant had no prior knowledge or personal connection to the Whiskey Ring. Undoubtedly, corruption did occur under Grant in part due to his inability to sense sincerity in the sphere of politics. Chernow can defend Grant’s competence in policy, yet defending his personality is more difficult. Regardless, Grant’s protection African Americans, implementation of universal (male) suffrage and achievements in foreign affairs have led historians, understandably, to bolster their evaluation of his Presidency.</p>
<h3 id="closing-remarks">Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>In conclusion, it has become evident that Chernow’s argument rings truest; Ulysses S. Grant should be lauded for his radical efforts in promoting racial equality, for implementing an honourable, if ultimately failed, Reconstruction program and for his political achievements. Even so, Chernow does concede, as almost all historians do, that Grant was clumsy in his handling of the personal in politics: the many scandals surrounding him undermined his administration, particularly during his second term. However, the battle for control over the narrative of the Reconstruction era has resulted in an egregious misunderstanding of one of its central figures. After all, the present directs interpretations of the past. Dunning’s work, which argues that Grant’s tenure was spectacularly disastrous, clearly lacks any nuance. It is deeply rooted in the prevailing southern ideology of the time, hence, examining Grant narrowly. He ignores the effect that Grant had on the African American community, concluding that the President’s desire for racial equality was oppressive and unlawful. Dunning latches onto allegations of Grant’s corruption to launch a blistering critique of the Grant administration’s conduct and of his personal competency, disregarding Grant’s major political victories. Wishing to re-evaluate Grant’s role in Reconstruction with a fairer head, Gillette, even with the benefit of the Civil Rights Era, argues that Grant was culpable for an incoherent, half-hearted Reconstruction. Gillette and Dunning’s interpretations contrast in that the former does not view Grant as accomplishing anything radical, diminishing his significance. In fact, he would argue that Grant was not fully committed to Reconstruction. Although such a view does put forth an alluringly simple explanation for the failure of Reconstruction, it contradicts much of the evidence (the Force Acts, the 15th amendment the 1875 Civil Rights Act). Gillette places meagre emphasis on the interplay between the panic of 1873 and dwindling national support for Reconstruction as reasons for its demise. Regarding the latter, Chernow is distinctly more attune, crediting Grant for persisting with Reconstruction despite its opposition. Perhaps Gillette’s desire to not glorify Grant resulted in a marked underestimation of Grant’s Presidency. Remarkably similar in their critiques of his political impulses, Dunning and Gillette correctly question Grant’s unbending nature which could cloud his judgment. On the contrary, Chernow provides evidence of commendable statesmanship, partially absolving Grant from these verdicts. Therefore, Grant’s admirable record on racial equality and insistence on a sound Reconstruction, as well as miscalculations over his corruption, demonstrates, as Chernow suggests, that Grant’s Presidency was by no means a disaster.</p>
